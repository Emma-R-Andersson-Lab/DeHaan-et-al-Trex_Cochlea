# De Haan et al, Otic placode and neural crest barcoding reveals cochlear compartmentalization 

This repository contains instructions to 
- Integrate various scRNAseq datasets using SCTransform (including QC and clustering) (notebook #1)
- extract CellIDs from integrated object needed for CloneID extraction using the Trex algorithm
- how to add the CloneIDs from the Trex output back to the Seurat object
- visualisation including Upset plots, Circos plots (as in Fig2 paper)  and Lineage Trees (as in Fig3 paper)


Overview of required files and flow of CloneID extraction and addiition to Seurat object
